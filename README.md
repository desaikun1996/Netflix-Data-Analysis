 Designed and developed a database application enabling end-users to view and book movie tickets. Constructed a well-defined and systematic ERD for the database, followed by developing SQL objects like Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers, Views, and Indexes, enabling end-to-end functioning of the application.
